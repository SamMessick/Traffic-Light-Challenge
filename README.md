<h3>Implementing a traffic-light state machine</h3>
<hr>
<p>
	These are my attempts at implementing a finite state machine of a traffic light. My only restrictions are that the logic 		implementing the state machine must be 
</p>
<p><b>
	1.) Minimized 
	2.) Free of static hazards
</b></p> 
<p>	
	Any other design considerations are acceptable.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<i>If you have any suggestions</i> on how to<br>
	or simplify this finite state machine any <br>
	further or have another method of implementing <br>
	traffic light logic, submit a pull request.
